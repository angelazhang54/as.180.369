# Political Regime Change and Real Interest Rates

Political regime change in the U.S. could significantly influence real interest rates, affecting the broader economy through mechanisms like fiscal policy changes, market expectations, and monetary policy adjustments. This research will investigate how different presidential adminstrations impact real interest rates, analyzing trends across regimes by examining inflation expectations, fiscal strategies, and monetary responses. I can look at existing theories and models on the relationship between political regime change and real interest rates as well as historical data. The findings could offer valuable insights for policymakers, helping them anticipate interest rate shifts in response to elections and design more stable economic policies.
