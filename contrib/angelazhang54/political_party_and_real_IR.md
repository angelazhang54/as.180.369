# Political Regime Change and Real Interest Rates

Political regime change could have an impact on a countryâ€™s real interest rates and thereby impact its overall economic growth. I would like to research if mechanisms such as fiscal policy or market expectations associated with different presidential administrations affect real interest rates. I can look at theories on the relationship between political regime change and how it affects the economy, as well as existing related studies for relevant historical data. I will look at factors affecting real interest rates, such as inflation expectations or monetary/fiscal policy, and try to connect those factors with any trends in real interest rates during different political regimes. This paper could help policymakers predict interest rate movements based on election trends and design more resilient economic policies for the overall wellbeing of the economy.
