# Literature Review 

Although electronic payments have grown rapidly, cash remains a dominant choice for small-value transactions, a focus that this literature review will trace and examine to provide a foundation for the present analysis.

Researchers began examining factors influencing consumer payment choices in the 2000s. Borzekowski et al. {cite:t}Borzekowski2006-kh (2006) provided early insights into consumers' use of debit cards by exploring patterns, preferences, and price responses. This study laid the groundwork for understanding the early adoption of electronic payments, setting the stage for more nuanced analyses in subsequent years.

In the early 2010s, research increasingly focused on the nuances of consumer payment behavior. Cohen and Rysman {cite:t}Cohen2013-vs (2013) used scanner data to track payment choices for grocery purchases over three years. Their study revealed that households tend to concentrate spending on one or two payment instruments, with cash overwhelmingly preferred for the smallest transactions. This study highlights the importance of transaction size in consumer choice.

Several studies in 2014 further expanded our understanding of consumer payment preferences. Wang and Wolman {cite:t}Wang2014-tc analyzed two billion retail transactions, revealing emerging trends and providing insights into the future of currency. Von Kalckreuth et al. {cite:t}Kalckreuth2014-fm suggested that consumers prefer cash for small transactions due to liquidity control needs and the high cognitive cost of processing information. Huynh et al. {cite:t}Huynh2014-sg examined how merchant card acceptance affects consumer payment choices and cash holdings, providing key insights into the demand for cash in relation to card acceptance.

Arango et al. {cite:t}Arango2015-yq (2015) brought attention to the supply side, demonstrating that a lack of merchant card acceptance still significantly drives cash usage, particularly for transactions under $25. This analysis expands on merchant influence, a factor increasingly recognized as shaping consumer preferences.

In 2016, Koulayev et al. {cite:t}Koulayev2016-af developed a structural model explaining the adoption and use of payment instruments by U.S. consumers. Their work offered valuable insights into how consumers decide which payment methods to adopt and use for specific transactions.

The year 2017 saw several important contributions to the field. Stavins {cite:t}Stavins2017-ns identified a broad range of influences on consumer payment behavior, including demographics, income, habits, and assessments of payment method attributes. Wakamori and Welte {cite:t}Wakamori2017-hr used shopping diary data to challenge the notion that cash usage is driven primarily by a lack of merchant card acceptance. Their findings suggested that, even with universal card acceptance, cash usage for small-value transactions would only decrease marginally, indicating that consumer preference plays a central role. Van der Cruijsen et al. {cite:t}Cruijsen2017-rl captured the complex relationship between consumers and payment methods in their study "In love with the debit card but still married to cash," emphasizing the enduring preference for cash despite the growing popularity of debit cards.

Most recently, Shy {cite:t}Shy2023-vc (2023), in his comprehensive review "Cash Is Alive: How Economists Explain Holding and Use of Cash," synthesized various economic explanations for the continued prevalence of cash and reflected on its persistence in an increasingly digital age.

In summary, the literature highlights that despite the growth of digital payments, cash persists due to factors such as transaction size, consumer preference, and merchant acceptance. These insights are crucial for understanding shifts in the payment landscape.
