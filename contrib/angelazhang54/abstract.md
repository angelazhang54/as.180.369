# Abstract 

This paper analyzes consumer payment preference trends in the United States. We investigate whether consumers have a preference for paying in-person with cash vs card for small value transactions. We define “small value transactions” as transactions with value under $25, and we limit the scope of the paper to in-person payments. To answer the question, we look at data on the average number of in-person payments per month under $25, which also includes the type of payments consumers used, from the annual Diary of Consumer Payment Choice released by the Federal Reserve. We compare the number of cash vs card payments over the years and test if consumers have an increasing preference for paying in credit card over cash for small value transactions when paying in person.
We find that, more small value transactions are done with card when paying in person, but the number of payments in cash has not decreased by much either. These results could affect government policies regarding cash demand as well as developing efficient payment systems for the economy.
