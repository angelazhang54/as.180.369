# Abstract 

This paper investigates the determinants of consumer payment preferences for small-value, in-person transactions in the United States, focusing on the choice between cash and card payments for transactions under $25. As digital payment methods proliferate, understanding these preferences is crucial for shaping economic policy and business strategy. Utilizing data from the Federal Reserve's annual Diary of Consumer Payment Choice from 2008-2024, we employ panel data analysis to track trends in payment method selection over time. Our analysis reveals that although card payments now constitute a growing proportion of such transactions, cash usage has not significantly declined, suggesting the persistence of cash alongside increased card usage. These findings carry significant implications for public policy, particularly concerning financial inclusion and the evolving role of cash, as well as for retailers and payment service providers, who must adapt to increasingly diverse payment preferences. Future research could examine the impact of emerging digital payment methods on the persistence of cash usage.
