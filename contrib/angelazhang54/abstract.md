# Abstract 

This paper examines consumer payment preferences for small value transactions in the United States, focusing on the choice between cash and card payments for in-person transactions under $25. As digital payment methods become increasingly prevalent, understanding these preferences is essential for both economic policy and business strategy. Using data from the Federal Reserve's annual Diary of Consumer Payment Choice, we analyze trends in the average number of monthly in-person payments under $25, categorized by payment method. Our research employs a longitudinal approach. We compare cash and card usage patterns over several years to determine if there is an increasing preference for credit card payments over cash in these small value, in-person transactions.
Results indicate that while card payments now constitute a larger share of small value transactions, cash usage has not significantly decreased, suggesting a coexistence rather than a complete shift in payment methods. These findings have potential implications for government policies regarding cash demand, the development of efficient payment systems in the economy, and business strategies for retailers and payment service providers.
