# Abstract 

This paper investigates consumer payment preferences for small-value, in-person transactions in the United States, with a particular focus on the choice between cash and card payments for transactions under $25. As digital payment methods become increasingly prevalent, understanding these preferences is crucial for informing both economic policy and business strategy. Utilizing data from the Federal Reserve's annual Diary of Consumer Payment Choice, we analyze trends in the average number of monthly in-person transactions under $25, disaggregated by payment method. Adopting a longitudinal approach, we examine cash and card usage patterns over several years to assess whether there is a growing preference for card payments in these low-value, in-person transactions.
The results reveal that while card payments now constitute a larger proportion of such transactions, cash usage has not significantly declined, suggesting the persistence of cash alongside increased card usage. These findings have important implications for public policy regarding cash demand, the development of efficient payment systems, and business strategies for retailers and payment service providers.
