# Tools/Ideas I Would Consider Using AI For My Project

In writing my research paper, I could use large language models like ChatGPT to improve both the clarity and structure of my paper. ChatGPT can help refine my ideas by suggesting improvements in logical flow and generating counterarguments. For instance, if my analysis lacks depth, ChatGPT might propose alternative perspectives I hadn't initially considered, broadening the analytical scope of my research. In addition, ChatGPT can check for grammatical mistakes and help edit word choice based on specific settings, which will help make my writing seem more professional. For data analysis, ChatGPTâ€™s proficiency with coding in Python libraries like NumPy and pandas, or in Matlab, can simplify the technical aspects. Whether debugging code for econometric models or generating visuals for data from the Survey and Diary of Consumer Payment Choices, ChatGPT can make the coding process more efficient, which will allow me to focus on interpreting results with confidence in the computations.
