Given the advancement of artificial intelligence today, it is now possible to make counterfeit people that can pass as real people. These counterfeits are extremely dangerous to society, because they give powerful corporate and political organizations the ability to interfere with our judgement through manipulative conversations, exploiting people's fears, or other actions that make people more vulnerable. It is currently very hard to completely shut down this development, therefore it is essential that companies start to adopt preventive measures, such as a "watermark" system to label what is an AI product, and that people be educated on how to identify these "fake people". A set of laws punishing creators of counterfeit people is also critical and a very effective way to help protect our freedom and humanity.
