# Reaction to Dennet Article

In the article from the Atlantic “The Problem With Counterfeit People”, by Daniel C. Dennet, the author makes an argument about how companies using artificial intelligence to generate fake people are committing an immoral act and should be responsible for their actions. Given the advancement of artificial intelligence today, it is now possible to make counterfeit people that can pass as real people. These counterfeits are extremely dangerous to society, because they give powerful corporate and political organizations the ability to interfere with our judgment through manipulative conversations, exploiting people's fears, or other actions that make us more vulnerable. As people lose their ability to reason for themselves, trust between individuals also begins to erode, since it may soon be impossible to tell whether the 'person' you are interacting with is actually a human being. This breakdown in trust further exacerbates our vulnerability to manipulation. A big danger about this system is that artificial intelligence can learn from each other and evolve independently, potentially taking control out of the developers' hands. This raises a broader issue of artificial intelligence autonomy, which underscores the need for preventive measures before things start to get out of hand. One such measure is a 'watermark' system to label AI-generated content, ensuring that as artificial intelligence systems evolve, we can still distinguish between human and machine interactions. By implementing such safeguards early, we can mitigate the risks associated with both artificial intelligence autonomy and counterfeit people. A set of laws punishing creators of counterfeit people is also critical and a very effective way to help protect our freedom and humanity, as making sure companies that produce artificial intelligence products are held responsible for their developments would keep companies in line and enhance the safety of the consumers. Companies should be able to enjoy the rewards of their developments but should also be prepared to be fined or go to jail if they fail to meet the ethical obligations for their use of artificial intelligence in product development. The article ends by saying although artificial intelligence is already deeply rooted in our lives due to all the platform algorithms online, we can still try to save our freedom to think by regulating developers of artificial intelligence products.

I believe this can turn out to be a potentially terrifying situation if left unregulated. It could rob us of our future and freedom to reason, and the public would become passive about the world around them. It is critical that there be a way people can tell between what is an artificial intelligence product and what is not. Given the significant funding and rapid advancement within the artificial intelligence industry, the best way to address these concerns is by placing legal liabilities on developers, ensuring they use artificial intelligence in ethical ways. This could be our only safeguard against losing our freedom of thought to powerful corporate and political entities who might otherwise exploit artificial intelligence to manipulate public opinion, leading us to subconsciously accept their policies and ideas.
