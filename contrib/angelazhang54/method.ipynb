    "For this research, I use data from the Federal Reserve's Diary of Consumer Payment Choice from 2012 to 2024. I focus only on in-person payments under $25.\n",

    "To analyze my data, I first look at how the number and percentage of cash vs. card payments changed over time from 2012 to 2023 and made a graph showing the change in number of cash and card payments each year.\n",

    "I used a logistic regression to look at how transaction size influences consumers' preferences for cash vs card. My dependent variable is whether someone uses cash (0) or card (1) for a payment. My independent variables is transaction size. My main regression equation is Prob(Cash Payment) = β₀ + β₁(transaction size) + ε\n",
