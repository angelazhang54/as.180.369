# The Economics of Intangible Capital

Intangible assets, such as intellectual property, software, and brand recognition, now constitute the majority of capital for many tech firms such as Microsoft and Google. In my paper, I would like to try to understand the economic implications of intangible capital and its effects on firm productivity and market valuation. This would involve examining traditional theories of physical capital and how intangible capital fits into or extends these models. I would also assess the correlation between investment in intangibles and firm performance, using metrics such as profitability or productivity growth, with a focus on industries like tech and pharmaceuticals where intangible assets drive innovation. I would also discuss difficulties in measuring and pricing intangibles and explore alternative approaches, ultimately contributing to  discussions on the rising importance of these assets in rapidly developing sectors.
