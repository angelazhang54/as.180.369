# The Economics of Intangible Capital

Currently, intangible assets make up the majority of the capital assets for many tech firms such as Microsoft and Google. In my paper, I would like to try to understand the economic implications of intangible capital and its effects on productivity and firm valuation. To answer this question, I could first look at traditional theories of physical capital and how intangible capital fits into or extends these models. I could also analyze statistics on the correlation between intangibles and firm performance or productivity growth rates. I would also discuss difficulties in measuring and pricing intangibles and explore alternative approaches, and contribute to relevant discussions as intangible assets become a bigger part of rapidly developing industries, such as tech and pharmaceuticals.
