# Introduction 

Today, consumers have a wide variety of payment options, from cash to credit card to debit card and even to mobile payment apps. Although many electronic payment methods have become more prevalent, many people still choose to make payments, particularly small-value payments, in cash. Many factors influence payment method choice, including transaction size, personal budgeting habits, and merchant acceptance. While card payments offer benefits such as cashback programs and electronic records of expenses, cash transactions are faster and help some consumers maintain stricter spending. 
Understanding consumer preferences in this area is important for businesses, financial institutions, and policymakers. For businesses, particularly merchants in the retail and food industries where small transactions are common, aligning payment systems with customer preferences can help increase profit. Financial institutions and technology companies developing payment solutions need to understand these preferences to create products that meet consumer needs. Central banks and governments must consider these trends when making decisions about the future of physical currency and the promotion of digital payment systems.
This paper will focus specifically on consumer preferences between cash and card payments for in-person transactions under $25 in the United States. Our research question is: Do consumers in the United States prefer using cash or card for in-person transactions under $25, and what factors influence this preference?
We will analyze data from the Survey and Diary of Consumer Payment Choice from 2008-2024 to identify patterns in payment preferences for in-person transactions under $25. By examining both payment data and insights into consumer decision-making processes, we hope to understand how and why individuals choose between cash and card payments as well as implications for businesses, financial institutions, and the economy.
In the following sections, we will look at existing relevant literature on this topic, explain our methodology, and discuss our findings as well as the broader implications. We hope to shed light on the persistence of cash usage in small transactions and contribute to ongoing discussions about the future of payment systems in today's increasingly digital economy.
