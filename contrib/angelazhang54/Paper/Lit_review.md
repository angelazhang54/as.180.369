# Literature Review

Although electronic payments have grown rapidly, cash remains a commonly used choice for small-value transactions, a trend this literature review will trace and examine to provide a foundation for the present analysis.

Researchers began examining factors influencing consumer payment choices in the 2000s. Borzekowski et al. {cite:t}`Borzekowski2006-kh` (2006) provided early insights into consumers' use of debit cards by examining usage patterns, payment preferences, and consumer responses to transaction fees and costs. This study laid the groundwork for understanding the early adoption of electronic payments, setting the stage for more nuanced analyses in subsequent years.

Several studies focus on how transaction characteristics influence payment preferences, particularly for smaller values. In the early 2010s, Cohen and Rysman {cite:t}`Cohen2013-vs` (2013) used scanner data to track payment choices for grocery purchases over three years, finding that households tend to concentrate spending on one or two payment instruments, with cash overwhelmingly preferred for the smallest transactions. This study highlighted the importance of transaction size in consumer choice. Wang and Wolman {cite:t}`Wang2014-tc` (2014) extended this analysis by examining two billion retail transactions to identify shifts in payment method usage, offering predictions for future cash and card use in an evolving payment landscape. Similarly, Von Kalckreuth et al. {cite:t}`Kalckreuth2014-fm` (2014) suggested that consumers prefer cash for small transactions due to its benefits in liquidity control and avoiding fees.

The availability of merchant card acceptance emerged as a significant factor in cash demand. Huynh et al. {cite:t}`Huynh2014-sg` (2014) explored how merchant acceptance of cards affects consumer payment choices and cash holdings, highlighting that limited card acceptance sustains cash usage. Arango et al. {cite:t}`Arango2015-yq` (2015) expanded on this, showing that a lack of merchant card acceptance drives cash use for transactions under $25, underscoring the influence of merchant practices on consumer preferences.

Additional research has explored broader determinants shaping consumer payment behaviors. Koulayev et al. {cite:t}`Koulayev2016-af` (2016) developed a structural model to explain U.S. consumers' adoption and use of payment instruments, showing how consumers decide which payment methods to use for different transactions. Stavins {cite:t}`Stavins2017-ns` (2017) identified various influences on payment behavior, such as demographics, income, and perceptions of payment attributes. Wakamori and Welte {cite:t}`Wakamori2017-hr` (2017) further explored consumer preferences, suggesting that even with universal card acceptance, cash usage for small-value transactions would decline only marginally, reflecting an intrinsic preference for cash. Van der Cruijsen et al. {cite:t}`Cruijsen2017-rl` (2017) echoed this sentiment in their study "In love with the debit card but still married to cash," noting an enduring consumer affinity for cash despite the growing popularity of debit cards.

Most recently, Shy {cite:t}`Shy2023-vc` (2023), in his comprehensive review "Cash Is Alive: How Economists Explain Holding and Use of Cash," synthesized various economic explanations for the continued prevalence of cash, reflecting on its persistence in an increasingly digital age.

In summary, the literature demonstrates that cash persists in small-value transactions due to specific consumer preferences, particularly for liquidity control and transaction simplicity, and is influenced by merchant card acceptance. These factors underline the complex dynamics of consumer payment behavior in a diversifying payment landscape.
