    "This study utilizes data from the Federal Reserve's Diary of Consumer Payment Choice (2012–2024), focusing exclusively on in-person transactions under $25.\n",
    "\n",
    "To analyze the data, I first examine trends in the volume and percentage shares of cash and card payments over time, covering the period from 2012 to 2023. I construct a graph illustrating the annual number of cash and card payments to highlight shifts in payment behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I identify the primary factors influencing consumers' choice between cash and card. Using the dataset, I extract respondents' stated reasons for their payment preferences, represented numerically. I organize these responses into a structured dataframe and compute the mode for each factor to determine the most frequently cited rationale.\n",
    "\n",
    "To assess the role of transaction size, I categorize payments into five groups: less than 10 dollars, 10–25 dollars, 25–50 dollars, 50–100 dollars, and over 100 dollars. For each group, I analyze consumers' payment method preferences and visualize the findings in a comparative graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "All analyses and visualizations are conducted using Python, leveraging tools such as Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib for graphical representation, and NumPy for numerical computations within a Jupyter Notebook environment."
