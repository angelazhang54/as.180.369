              and electronic payments in the United States, but there is also a
              large degree of heterogeneity among consumers in how they pay. We
              present factors affecting consumer payment behavior, show data on
              how consumers pay in the United States, and summarize existing
              literature on consumer payment choice. On the supply side,
              technology, regulation, and cost affect payment behavior. On the
              demand side, consumer demographics and income, consumer
              preferences, and consumer assessments of payment method attributes
              have all been found significant. We focus on price differentiation
              by payment method by merchants and the effect of such price
              incentives on payment method use, and on the effect of
              demographics and of perceptions of payment characteristics on
              consumer payment choice, emphasizing the effect of security. The
              studies mentioned here utilize a growing number of data sources,
              including several surveys and diaries on consumer behavior
              conducted in the United States and in other countries. We also
              identify gaps where more research is needed to understand consumer
              payment choices.",

               at most two of these instruments in choosing between using cash,
               a check, or a card, and they very rarely switch. We focus
               particularly on the role of expenditure size in determining
               payment choice. While the use of a long panel for these purposes
               is novel, the introduction of controls for household
               heterogeneity has little effect on our estimates. Thus, we find

               policy makers an important question is whether consumers truly
               prefer using cash or merchants restrict card usage. Using the
               Bank of Canada’s 2009 Method of Payment Survey, we estimate a
               generalized multinomial logit model of payment choices to extract
               individual heterogeneity (demand-side factors) while controlling
               for merchants’ acceptance of cards (supply-side factors). Based
               on a counterfactual exercise where we assume universal card
               acceptance among merchants, we find that some consumers would
               decrease their cash usage but the magnitude of this decrease is
               small. Our results imply that the use of cash in small-value
               transactions is driven mainly by consumers’ preferences.",
