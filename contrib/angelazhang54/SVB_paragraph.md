# The Failure of Silicon Valley Bank and the Panic of 2023

The failure of Silicon Valley Bank in 2023 brought attention to significant weaknesses in the US banking system and lead to a panic that spread to other vulnerable banks. I would like to analyze key factors that contributed to the failure of Silicon Valley Bank and what it shows about the resilience of the US financial system. I could identify key problems the bank faced as well as pressure from regulatory entities that eventually led to the collapse. I could also examine past banking crises and panics, comparing them to the events that happened during and after Silicon Valley Bank’s failure. In addition, I could try to identify potential future banking risks or similar crises in the tech industry or elsewhere. I would also include contagion effects and regulatory changes to the financial system in response to the larger financial panic following Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse.
