# The Failure of Silicon Valley Bank and the Panic of 2023

The failure of Silicon Valley Bank in 2023 highlighted significant weaknesses in the U.S. banking system and triggered a panic that spread to other vulnerable banks. This research aims to answer the central question: What key factors contributed to the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, and what does this event reveal about the resilience and fragility of the U.S. financial system? I could identify specific weaknesses, such as liquidity issues, that eventually led to its collapse. I could also examine past banking failures, comparing them to the Silicon Valley Bank crisis and identifying common patterns. Furthermore, I will explore the contagion effects that followed the collapse, including how fear spread across the banking sector, and evaluate the regulatory responses aimed at stabilizing the system. By identifying the root causes and examining broader systemic risks, I could identify potential future vulnerabilities in the tech banking sector and propose policy changes that could prevent similar collapses. The findings will contribute to ongoing discussions about strengthening the U.S. financial system in the wake of increasing economic uncertainty.
